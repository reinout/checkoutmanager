# directory.
#
# There are different sections per base location and version control
# system.
#
# ``checkoutmanager co`` checks them all out (or clones them).
# ``checkoutmanager up`` updates them all.
# ``checkoutmanager st`` to see if there are uncommitted changes.
# ``checkoutmanager out`` to see if there are unpushed git/hg commits.
